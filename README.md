By default, the python script looks for ‘bach.txt’ as its score file. 
This can be changed on line seven (score = open("bach.txt", “r”)), 
by changing “bach.txt” to the desired file name. 

Note that both .xml and .mxl files can be converted to a txt file simply by renaming the extension.
This step is necessary before running the python script.

Python scripts can be executed from the terminal with the command ./script_name.py
